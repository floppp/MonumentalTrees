** Main description
Project made as a home work for the subject "Android Programming Fundamentlals", part of the (Master de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Móviles)[http://mmoviles.upv.es].  
It works as a list/map with that shows trees that has been classified as monumental.  
The app has being developed in Java. I like Kotlin, but i want to refresh Java and, honestly, i feel building time for Java is shorter than for Kotlin.
