# Main description

Project made as a home work for the subject "Android Programming Fundamentlals", part of the (Master de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Móviles)[<http://mmoviles.upv.es>]. It works as a list/map with that shows trees that has been classified as monumental. The app has being developed in Java. I like Kotlin, but i want to refresh Java and, honestly, i feel building time for Java is shorter than for Kotlin.
